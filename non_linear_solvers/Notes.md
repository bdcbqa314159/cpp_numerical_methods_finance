# Non-linear solvers

We explain briefly the Black-Scholes formula for a call and how we want to match the quote to get an estimate of the volatility.

We also explain the bisection method as a searching algorithm.

Finally we explain the Newton-Raphson method.

## Remarks on templates

One diffi culty with templates is that they are prone to programming bugs and can be harder to debug than code without templates, producing mystifying compiler errors. On the other hand, templates capturing some generic data structures and tasks can save a huge amount of coding, reducing the scope for errors and improving readability.
